# VoxelSync
A tool synchronizes voxelmap files among Minecraft players.
VoxelMap is a minecraft mod that shows (and records) 2d map. It records areas that local player once reached and the outsides remains black.  
This program was created to synchronize these map files among all players so that everyone can see areas that was reached by anyone.

## Atention 注意
This program was only designed to be used among several friends that play Minecraft together.  
The programs have a basic user interface which enables one-click synchronizaion, and relies on **pre-written** config file to work, 
Which means **you won't be able to use it**, generally speaking. 
这个东西只是跟几个一起van Minecraft的姬友用来同步VoxelMap小地图的，依赖于预先编写的配置文件来工作，也就是说通常来讲你下载了是用不了的。 

## Things would be added if it's decided to be made public, but not now.
